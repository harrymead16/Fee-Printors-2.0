            <p class="article__text">Hey everyone, it’s Harry here! If you’re new to my story, I’m originally from London, but I grew up in Spain. I’m a front-end developer and content creator at Fee Printors, where I’m delving into the world of decentralized finance. My Solana journey started back in 2021, when the NFT scene really took off. I was living the dream, traveling through South America, moving from Colombia to Brazil, and supplementing my travels with some NFT trading on the side.</p>

            <p class="article__text">Back then, I started with just $500. I bought and sold NFTs, using the fast-moving Solana ecosystem to my advantage. I had some wins, but I also got rugged a few times. By the time I reached $6,000 in profits, I had gained a solid understanding of the market. But by 2024, the NFT hype had cooled down, and I found myself ready for a new challenge.</p>

            <p class="article__text">While traveling through Thailand, I stumbled upon Dynamic Liquidity Market Making (DLMM) on Solana. At first, I didn’t fully understand what I was doing; I was just copying strategies that seemed to work for others. However, fast forward to today, and I’m living in Perth, Australia, and I’ve gained a new perspective on DLMM.</p>

            <p class="article__text">With tools like Meteora’s predictive charts and insights from Nansen, shared by Paul (the founder of Fee Printors), I’m refining my strategies. Just a few weeks ago, I couldn’t have told you the difference between a tight and wide range in DLMM. But now, I’ve made several successful trades, bringing in around $40—modest earnings, but I’m learning, building confidence, and adapting.</p>

            <p class="article__text">Meteora has played a crucial role in my journey, offering powerful tools that help me make more precise decisions with my liquidity provision. I’ve learned that DLMM isn’t just about jumping in and out of trades—it’s about understanding market trends, risk management, and adapting to real-time data.</p>

            <p class="article__text">Looking back, my journey with Solana has been all about learning and evolving. From the world of NFTs to the deeper, more strategic world of DLMM, I’ve gained valuable insights into the fast-paced world of decentralized finance. It’s a thrilling ride, and I’m excited to continue learning, trading, and who knows—maybe funding more adventures with this new venture.</p>

            <p class="article__text">Here’s to more trades, more lessons, and maybe more travel—this time funded by DLMM on Solana and Meteora!</p>
